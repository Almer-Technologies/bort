# Bort: Memfault Bug Report SDK for AOSP

## Overview

The purpose of the Bort SDK is to make it really easy to collect detailed
diagnostics from your entire Android device, from low-level or hardware issues
to high-level application crashes, and upload them automatically to Memfault.

See [Memfault Bort SDK Reference](https://mflt.io/android-bort-sdk) for more
information.
