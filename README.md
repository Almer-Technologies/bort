# Bort: Memfault SDK for AOSP

The purpose of the Bort SDK is to make it really easy to collect detailed
diagnostics from your entire Android device, from low-level or hardware issues
to high-level application crashes, and upload them automatically to Memfault.

See the [Memfault Android Documentation](https://mflt.io/android) for more
information.
